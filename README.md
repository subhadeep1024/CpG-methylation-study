# CpG-methylation study

Create a directory as the name of the cell line and place the RRBS-MsP1 experiment files (all replicates) there. In this examples the directory name (the cell line) is BE2C and the experiment files are ENCFF001TLC.bed.gz and ENCFF001TLD.bed.gz. downloaded from encodeproject repository.

This analysis requires 1 script command.sh to run. This script is hard coded. Change the names of the files accordingly.
command.sh calls another script parser_CpG.pl. this script should be kept at same directory
